# *A silly game based upon a generic and redundant idea.*

*(sorry if this is difficult to understand, i just suck at choosing what words to use)*
Don't just distribute a modified (or the same and original) version of this game that isn't free, please.

I soon plan to add multiplayer gamemode to this game, and if I figure out how to use github, I'll make it so that you can't modify the multiplayer part
of the game because that could be considered "hacking/exploiting/cheating."

If I fail to make it so that you can't modify the multiplayer part
of the game, please don't modify the multiplayer part of the game.

I might "borrow" some code from some of the modified distributed copies
